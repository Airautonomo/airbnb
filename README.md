## MyAirbnb Clone


## What was learned 

I learned alot making this clone.
I learned about the new styled components API in MUI V5,
I learned about the grid system and its spaceing. 
Particularly it applies margin to the top and left side of grid items for spacing.
In order to get things centered you need to apply margin to the right for the last items.
The package size of this repo is probably huge because i didn't bother to import icons one at a time
In a real project I would.
Also after soending too much time on breakpoints for the nav bar I sort of rushed through the rest of the site,






## Code splitting
I learned about code splitting and am excited to try it in my own projects.
I also experimented with imports and found this


✨faster!✨!
```
import foo from folder/foo
```

🐌slower!🐌
```
import {foo} from folder
```

#This Airbnb clone is  
-mobile-ready using mediaQuery hook

-Uses the latest version of MUI



## About

This is a Clone of the Airbnb Landing page.
It is made using React, 
- using styled components
- the makeStyles hook.
- a theme 
- media querys

It has been a really fun project to make and is only about 1/3 way through!
I am expecting it to have 3 Nav Bars!
