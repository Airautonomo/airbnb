#This Airbnb clone is  
-mobile-ready using mediaQuery hook

-Uses the latest version of MUI



## About

This is a Clone of the Airbnb Landing page.
It is made using React, 
- using styled components
- the makeStyles hook.
- a theme 
- media querys

It has been a really fun project to make and is only about 1/3 way through!
I am expecting it to have 3 Nav Bars!
